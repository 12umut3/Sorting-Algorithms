# Sorting-Algorithms

Consider instance sizes n = 2^4 , 2^8 , 2^12 , 2^16 , 2^20 . Generate 10 random instances (such
that either the numbers in the array are randomly generated, or the ordering of the numbers
is randomized) and plotting the runtime of each algorithm as a function of n (using error
bars to visualize the distribution of runtimes for different random instances).
Finding at what value of n does Merge-Sort become more efficient than Insertion-Sort.
